# Alglide - Kotlin image lazy loading library

*This project is not intended to be used in production*

## Introduction:

[Assigment is described here](https://gist.github.com/spinach/3934578e3e607050aacb66a62aadc866)

Lazy loading images is a mature subject on Android. 3 Major libraries already exist: Glide, Picasso, Fresco.
A new library: Coil was designed with Kotlin first support and seems to have some momentum: [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil).

As we cannot compete with any of these projects in the scope of the assignment, we will target: *minimal feature-set*, *expressiveness*, *continuous integration*.
